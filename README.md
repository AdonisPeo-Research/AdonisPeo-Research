## **Projects & Research**

Here are a few key projects I'm working on:

### 1. **Numerical Simulation of Particle Trajectories in Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and Radio Frequency Octupole (RFO) Fields Using Euler and Runge-Kutta Methods**

- **Description:** This project presents a numerical simulation of particle trajectories in RFQ and RFO fields, analyzing how frequency and voltage affect the acceleration of test charges (e.g., alpha and beta particles). Both the Euler method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method are employed to solve the equation of motion under time-varying electric fields. The results explore the accuracy, computational efficiency, and stability of the methods, providing insights into the design and optimization of RF-based particle accelerators.
  
- **Key Features:**
    - Simulation of charged particle trajectories in RF fields
    - Comparison of Euler and Runge-Kutta methods
    - Analysis of frequency and voltage impact on acceleration
    - Theoretical framework supported by computational results
