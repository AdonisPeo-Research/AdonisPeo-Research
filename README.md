## 📂 What’s Inside?
Here’s the **TL;DR** of what this repository offers:  

1. **⚡ Numerical Simulation of Particle Trajectories in Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and Radio Frequency Octupole (RFO) Fields Using Euler and Runge-Kutta Methods**  
   - 🧪 _What_: This project presents a numerical simulation of particle trajectories in Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and Radio Frequency Octupole (RFO) field, with the aim of analyzing how frequency and voltage affect the acceleration of test charges, such as alpha and beta particles.Two numerical methods, the Euler method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, are employed to solve the equation of motion of the charged particles under the influence of time-varying electric fields generated by the RFQ and the RFO configurations. The results from both methods are compared to evaluate accuracy, computational efficiency, and stability. Additionally, the paper explores the impact of varying frequency and voltage on the trajectories and acceleration of particles. The study provides a comprehensive theoretical framework, supported by computational simulations, to contribute insights into the design and optimization of RF-based Particle Accelerators. The results demonstrate that the Runge-Kutta method offers superior accuracy for simulating particle dynamics in RF-fields, especially under high-frequency and high-voltage conditions.
   - 🛠️ _Tools_: Python, MATLAB, and some good ol' Physics.

2. **🧠 Numerical Analysis of Non-Ideal Cylindrical Waveguides with Surface Roughness**  
   - 🤖 _What_: Surface roughness significantly impacts the performance of the cylindrical waveguides, particularly in high-frequency applications. This paper presents a numerical analysis of waveguides with non-ideal surface conditions, focusing on their influence on propagation constants, attenuation, and mode behavior. Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations are performed across a range of frequencies to investigate the deviation in electromagnetic wave propagation due to surface roughness. Error analysis using a Python-based approach is present to ensure the robustness of the numerical results. Results indicate a substantial increase in attenuation and shifts in the propagation constant, emphasizing the need to account for roughness in practical waveguide design..
